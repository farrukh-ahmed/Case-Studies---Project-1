## Tasks for this week


- same Dataset, same split, randomization, same validation (Raafey)
- quadratic influence in resid plots - dia messwert plot (Amir)
- put conf intervals in summary table for lm with values of estimated parameters (Aymane)
- investigate the type of tree model - Vimann (Farrukh/Raafey)
- add methods for LM (Aymane)
 * dummy encoding for variables
 * Linear Regression
    . Assumptions
    . Equations for parameter estimation
    . Hypothesis testing & confidence intervals
    . evaluate models prediction error
- Investigate advanced methods (Aymane) [if there's time]
- Methods for R squared, BIC, best subset selection, cross_validation / Implementation & methods (Raafey)
- Measures for comparison (Amir)
    * have measures to compare models from different model classes
    * compare these measures in terms of whether or not they give different answers 
    * compare prediction errors
    * describe parameters in a way customer understands
- RECHECK THE PLOTS PLS
