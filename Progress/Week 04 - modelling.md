# Tasks for this week

## Binomials: 
- Aymane / Amir
- Raafey / Farrukh

## General Common stuff
### Implementation (Raafey)
- Same Dataset, same split, randomization, same validation, valid transformations
- Refactor code into one single notebook 

### Methods (Farrukh)
 - Describe dataset used, null values dropped, what variables transformed, counts of everthing etc.
 - Methods for R squared, BIC, best subset selection/cross_validation

## Regression Trees
### Methods (Farrukh)
- State what Ensemble Methods you used and their algorithms/assumptions
- State type of tree model and algorithm for that tree
- Analysis on results of prediction errors

### Implementation (Raafey)
- Ensemble methods 
- Investigate the type of tree model - Definition
- Methods for R squared, BIC, best subset selection/cross_validation 
- Generate prediction errors

## Linear Models
### Methods (Amir)
- Dummy encoding for variables - Definition
- Assumptions - Definition
- Linear Regression - Definition
- Equations for parameter - Definition
- Hypothesis testing & confidence intervals  - Definition
- Residuals Plots - Definition
- Variable transformation - Definition

### Implementation (Aymne)
- Quadratic influence in resid plots - dia messwert plot
- Linear Regression
    - Equations for parameter estimation
    - Hypothesis testing & confidence intervals
    - Evaluate models prediction error
    - Put conf intervals in summary table for lm with values of estimated parameters
- Investigate advanced methods [if there's time]
- Methods for R squared, BIC, best subset selection - cross_validation 
- Generate prediction errors - Implementation

## Evaluation
### Methods (Raafey) 
- Have measures to compare models from different model classes
- Compare these measures in terms of whether or not they give different answers 
- Compare prediction errors - Analysis
- Describe parameters in a way customer understands

## Old Pending Tasks
 - Generate plots from week02 (Farrukh)
